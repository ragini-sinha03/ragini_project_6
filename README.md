```

## üìà Custom Components

### Ragini's Producer (`producers/ragini_producer.py`)
- Generates personalized "Hello World" messages with realistic metadata
- Writes to multiple sinks simultaneously (file, SQLite, DuckDB)
- Configurable message intervals and data patterns
- Includes sentiment analysis and message length statistics

### Ragini's Custom Visual Consumer (`consumers/ragini_visual_consumer.py`)

My custom consumer represents a sophisticated streaming analytics solution that transforms raw message data into actionable business insights through real-time visualization. Built with professional-grade architecture, this consumer demonstrates advanced streaming data processing patterns suitable for enterprise environments.

**Core Capabilities:**
- **Intelligent Data Ingestion**: Multi-source data reading from local files (JSONL, JSON) and Kafka topics with automatic fallback mechanisms
- **Real-time Processing**: Background threading ensures continuous data collection without blocking the user interface
- **Advanced Analytics**: Performs sentiment analysis, message length statistics, author activity tracking, and temporal trend analysis
- **Dynamic Visualization**: 4-panel matplotlib dashboard with animated charts updating every 2 seconds
- **Memory Management**: Uses efficient deque data structures with configurable buffer limits (50 messages for time series, 30 for analysis)

**Technical Innovation:**
- **Multi-threaded Architecture**: Separates data collection from visualization rendering for smooth performance
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Automatic matplotlib backend detection (TkAgg, Qt5Agg, Agg) ensures GUI compatibility across Windows, WSL, and Linux
- **Error Resilience**: Graceful handling of missing data sources, GUI backend failures, and network connectivity issues
- **Statistical Computing**: Real-time calculation of rolling averages, distribution analysis, and anomaly detection zones

**Business Value**: The consumer provides immediate insights into data patterns, user engagement trends, and system performance metrics, making it suitable for applications ranging from IoT monitoring to social media analytics and manufacturing quality control.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Key Technologies
- **Python 3.11**: Core programming language
- **Matplotlib**: Real-time dashboard with automatic GUI backend selection
- **Pandas**: Data processing and analysis
- **SQLite/DuckDB**: Local database storage
- **Kafka**: Distributed streaming (optional)
- **Threading**: Background processing for smooth animations

### Emitter System
Multiple output destinations in `utils/emitters/`:
- **File Emitter**: Saves data to JSONL files
- **SQLite Emitter**: Stores in relational database
- **DuckDB Emitter**: Analytics-focused database storage
- **Kafka Emitter**: Distributed messaging

Each emitter works independently - if one fails, others continue working.

### Performance Features
- **Deque-based data structures** for efficient memory management
- **Background threading** for non-blocking data collection
- **Configurable buffer sizes** (50 messages for time series, 30 for analysis)
- **Graceful error handling** with fallback mechanisms

## üìä Dashboard Analytics

The visualization system provides real-time insights including:

- **Message Throughput**: Track processing velocity over time
- **Author Activity**: Monitor contributor engagement patterns  
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze emotional trends with color-coded zones
- **Message Characteristics**: Statistical analysis of content patterns
- **System Health**: Real-time status and performance metrics


## üéØ Use Cases

This streaming system demonstrates patterns applicable to:

- **IoT Sensor Monitoring**: Real-time device data processing
- **Social Media Analytics**: Live sentiment and engagement tracking  
- **Financial Trading**: Market data streaming and analysis
- **Manufacturing**: Production line monitoring and quality control
- **Log Analysis**: System monitoring and alerting

## Task 1. Optional: Start Kafka for Full Streaming

In P2, you downloaded, installed, configured a local Kafka service.
Before starting, run a short prep script to ensure Kafka has a persistent data directory and meta.properties set up. This step works on WSL, macOS, and Linux - be sure you have the $ prompt and you are in the root project folder.

1. Make sure the script is executable.
2. Run the shell script to set up Kafka.
3. Cd (change directory) to the kafka directory.
4. Start the Kafka server in the foreground. Keep this terminal open - Kafka will run here.

```bash
chmod +x scripts/prepare_kafka.sh
scripts/prepare_kafka.sh
cd ~/kafka
bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/kraft/server.properties
```

**Keep this terminal open!** Kafka is running and needs to stay active.

For detailed instructions, see [SETUP_KAFKA](https://github.com/denisecase/buzzline-02-case/blob/main/SETUP_KAFKA.md) from Project 2.

## Task 2. Manage Local Project Virtual Environment

Open your project in VS Code and use the commands for your operating system to:

1. Create a Python virtual environment.
2. Activate the virtual environment.
3. Upgrade pip and key tools. 
4. Install from requirements.txt.

### Windows

Open a new PowerShell terminal in VS Code (Terminal / New Terminal / PowerShell).
**Python 3.11** is required for Apache Kafka. 

```powershell
py -3.11 -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
py -m pip install --upgrade pip wheel setuptools
py -m pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

If you get execution policy error, run this first:
`Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`

### Mac / Linux

Open a new terminal in VS Code (Terminal / New Terminal)

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Task 3. Run Tests and Verify Emitters

In the same terminal used for Task 2, we'll run some tests to ensure that all four emitters are working fine on your machine.  All tests should pass if everything is installed and set up correctly. 

```shell
pytest -v
```

Then run the `verify_emitters.py` script as a module to check that we can emit to all four types. 
For the Kakfa sink to work, the Kafka service must be running. 

### Windows Powershell

```shell
py -m verify_emitters
```

### Mac / Linux

```shell
python3 -m verify_emitters
```

---

## Task 4. Start a New Streaming Application

This will take two terminals:

1. One to run the producer which writes messages using various emitters. 
2. Another to run each consumer. 

### Producer Terminal (Outputs to Various Sinks)

Start the producer to generate the messages. 

The existing producer writes messages to a live data file in the data folder.
If the Kafka service is running, it will try to write the messages to a Kafka topic as well.
For configuration details, see the .env file. 

In VS Code, open a NEW terminal.
Use the commands below to activate .venv, and start the producer. 

Windows:

```shell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
py -m producers.producer_case
```

Mac/Linux:
```zsh
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m producers.producer_case
```

NOTE: The producer will still work if the Kafka service is not available.

### Consumer Terminal (Various Options)

Start an associated consumer. 
You have options. 

1. Start the consumer that reads from the live data file.
2. Start the consumer that reads from the Kafka topic.
3. Start the consumer that reads from the SQLite relational data store. 
4. Start the consumer that reads from the DuckDB relational data store.

In VS Code, open a NEW terminal in your root project folder. 
Use the commands below to activate .venv, and start the consumer. 

Windows:
```shell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
py -m consumers.kafka_consumer_case
OR
py -m consumers.file_consumer_case
OR
py -m consumers.sqlite_consumer_case.py
OR
py -m consumers.duckdb_consumer_case.py
```

Mac/Linux:
```zsh
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m consumers.kafka_consumer_case
OR
python3 -m consumers.file_consumer_case
OR
python3 -m consumers.sqlite_consumer_case.py
OR
python3 -m consumers.duckdb_consumer_case.py
```

## Review the Project Code

Review the requirements.txt file. 
- What - if any - new requirements do we need for this project?
- Note that requirements.txt now lists both kafka-python and six. 
- What are some common dependencies as we incorporate data stores into our streaming pipelines?

Review the .env file with the environment variables.
- Why is it helpful to put some settings in a text file?
- As we add database access and passwords, we start to keep two versions: 
   - .env 
   - .env.example
 - Read the notes in those files - which one is typically NOT added to source control?
 - How do we ignore a file so it doesn't get published in GitHub (hint: .gitignore)

Review the .gitignore file.
- What new entry has been added?

Review the code for the producer and the two consumers.
 - Understand how the information is generated by the producer.
 - Understand how the different consumers read, process, and store information in a data store?

Compare the consumer that reads from a live data file and the consumer that reads from a Kafka topic.
- Which functions are the same for both?
- Which parts are different?

What files are in the utils folder? 
- Why bother breaking functions out into utility modules?
- Would similar streaming projects be likely to take advantage of any of these files?
